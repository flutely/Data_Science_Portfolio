# Cross Validation

Have you ever wondered how well your statistical model is doing to model the data? One way to show model accuracy is using a method called cross validation.

## Overview

This page will cover the folowing:
- What is Cross Validation?
- \(k\)-fold Cross Validation
- Coding Cross Validation in Python
- Tradeoff between Bias and Variance

We'll use [Adult Income](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset?resource=download) data as an example.

## What is Cross Validation?

Cross-validation is the process of splitting a dataset into two pieces and using one to fit a model, and the other piece to check the fit. 

## \(k\)-fold Cross Validation

There are a few steps to cross-validation
1) Split the data into \(k\) folds

In this step 

2) Train on \(k-1\) folds

3) Validate on remaining fold

4) Repeat \(k\) times

5) Average performance

## Coding Cross Validaion in Python

We'll start by loading the necessary libraries and the data.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

adult_income = read_csv("adult.csv")
```

1) Split the data into \(k\) folds.

Here we're going to use \(k=5\) folds.
